# deep_learning_fpga
Implementation of Deep Learning strategies for the FPGA in VHDL.

The idea is to detect certain audio signals by using a FPGA and an Autoencoder.
The specific use case, that is used in this project is to be able to detect the screech noise that a trains is doing when driving through a curve and spray water to prevent it. Therefore a rapid detection e.g. with a FPGA is needed.


For a good overview start reading the [walkthrough](https://github.com/julianhatzky/deep_learning_fpga/blob/master/walkthrough.pdf)
or the [exhibition slides] (https://github.com/julianhatzky/deep_learning_fpga/blob/master/Dokumentation%20der%20Anforderungen%2CSpezifikation%2C%20Architektur%2C%20Komponenten%20(Arbeitsaufteilung)%20und%20der%20Integration/Milestones/Milestone_6_%20final%20report/Exhibition_Slides/Slides%20for%20the%20Exhibition%20at%20TH%20K%C3%B6ln.pptx) 

By publishing the authors hopes that people can use the work to develop their own audio detection mechanism for a FPGA and to increase the overall research on deep learning for FPGAs.
